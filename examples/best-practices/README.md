# Best Practices

## Purpose

This directory contains examples demonstrating core prompt engineering principles and best practices. These examples serve as foundational patterns that should be applied across all prompt engineering work.

## Examples

### introduction.py

**Lesson:** Learn the fundamental structure of a prompt engineering script and how to ask clear, direct questions to get accurate responses.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to structure a basic OpenAI API call
- The importance of clear, specific questions
- Understanding the response format

**Run from root:**
```bash
python examples/best-practices/introduction.py
```

**Key takeaway:** Start with clear, direct questions and build complexity from there. The quality of your prompt directly impacts the quality of the response.
